# Dice Game

### Game Rules (English)


#### 1. Setting the Score

- A Player enters the target score at "FINAL SCORE" and clicks "SET SCORE" to complete the setting. Any game requires a score setting before it starts.

#### 2. Game Starts

- Player clicks "ROLL DICE" to roll two dices at a time, and the sum of the points of the dices is the current score.

- If Player chooses to continue rolling dices (click "ROLL DICE"), the current score will be accumulated until either point of the two dices is 1. At this time, Player clicks "CONFIRM" and the current score will be reset to zero. Next, it's the other Player's turn to roll the dices.

- If Player chooses to hold the current score (click "HOLD"), the current score will be added to the total score and then be cleared. Next, it's the other Player's turn to roll the dices.

#### 3. Game Over

- Any Player reaches the target score wins. Player clicks "NEW GAME" to start a new game.
